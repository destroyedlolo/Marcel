Alarming
========

Topic : Alarm/<subject>
	- <subject> to identify the alert 
Payload : [S|E]error message
	- S : start of the alert
	- E : End of the alert
	- error message : information to be send.

Lua user function
=================

Lua stores its own information in a context which is not thread safe.
I had 2 options :
1/ to create a dedicated context per section (implemented as thread), but in this case, each and every callback lives its own life and can't share code or information with others
2/ to use an unique context and lock it's access.

I choose the 2nd way which is more "natural" for users, but as a consequence, only one callback can run at a time. It means callbacks must be as fast as possible to avoid dead locks.

1-wire alarms
=============

basement door :
---------------
