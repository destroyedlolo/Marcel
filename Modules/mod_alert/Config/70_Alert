# Alerts handling

Needs=mod_alert

# Legacy 'Alert/#'
# if the first character of an 'Alert/#' payload is a 'S' or 's', the alert is raised.
# any other character means the alert is over.
# With a 'S' both RESTURL and AlertCommand is called.
# with a 's' only AlertCommand is called.
#
# When an alert is raised, a message to %MarcelID%/Error is published
# When closed, %MarcelID%/Log/Corrected is published
# Every time, AlertsCounter is published to "AlertsCounterTopic=" if set, the amount of active alerts
#

# Several RaiseAlert / CorrectAlert could coexist :
# it's allowing different actions to trigger,
# but it's not segregating alerts, all alerts are stored the same way.
